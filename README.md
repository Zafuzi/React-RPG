## Description

_Void is an RPG built from the ground up using React, Redux, and Firebase. It allows for quick response times and interactibility. It uses a lot of ideas from previous games I've played such as Avabor(A Persistant Online Browser Based RPG), and Path of Exil(An ARPG created by Grinding Gear Games). I'm attempting to create something hard and difficult, but also something that is fun to play._
