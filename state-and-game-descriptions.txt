The state for this game will most likely become very complex.

I need state for conditional UI rendering, and state for the character

UI State:

createdCharacter: false/true - Will determine if a character is created or not, and will change the "Create a Character" link to "Enter the Hub"
introText: 0-5 - Will allow the user to click a button to progress the intro text, after it hits 5, the player should be able to view the zones and pylons.
pylonAmount: Possibly create a state to determine the highest level zone a character has completed?

Character State:


character: {
        name: name, - Self Explanitory, the character's name
        enlightenment: 1, - Traditional Character Level called Enlightenment
        spark: 1, - Similar to Strength, used for Battling
        luminosity: 1, - A unique stat that will be used to determine if a character can explore a zone/ruin freely or not
        items: [] - The character's items
    }
