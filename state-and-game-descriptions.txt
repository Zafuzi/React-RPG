The state for this game will most likely become very complex.

I need state for conditional UI rendering, and state for the character

UI State:

createdCharacter: false/true - Will determine if a character is created or not, and will change the "Create a Character" link to "Enter the Hub"

introText: 0-5 - Will allow the user to click a button to progress the intro text, after it hits 5, the player should be able to view the zones and pylons.

The three Pylon states will allow the HUB to show the information of if a character has activated a pylon or not. Each pylon will require a specific relic from a zone to activate.
pylonAlpha: false
pylonBeta: false
pylonGamma: false

Character State:


character: {
        name: name, - Self Explanitory, the character's name
        enlightenment: 1, - Traditional Character Level called Enlightenment
        spark: 1, - Similar to Strength, used for Battling
        luminosity: 1, - A unique stat that will be used to determine if a character can explore a zone/ruin freely or not
        items: [] - The character's items
    }


Game Mechanics - 

Primarily revolving around exploring areas within the Zones. Most likely just a single Explore action while in the zone. This will be RNG based where you might get an event, or a combat might start. 

Structure - 
Structure a zone like this: ZoneOneComponent (press explore button) -> Randomizes 1-100 -> Random number picks Event or Battle or Whatever -> Load corresponding component (Hard coded information for each within the ZoneOneComponent)
