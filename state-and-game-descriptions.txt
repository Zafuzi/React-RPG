The state for this game will most likely become very complex.

I need state for conditional UI rendering, and state for the character

UI State:

NavBar/AuthButton State:
    hasCreatedACharacter: Determines if a user has created a character or not. This comes from the user's character data (store and firebase), and is read when the page is reloaded and if the user has logged in).

    hasLoggedIn:  Determines if the user has logged in. If they have not logged in, then the navbar does nothing and presents no links. The user must log in first, and if they have created a character then the HUB link shows up. And if they have not created a character, then the create a character link shows up.

introText: 0-5 - Will allow the user to click a button to progress the intro text, after it hits 5, the player should be able to view the zones and pylons.

The three Pylon states will allow the HUB to show the information of if a character has activated a pylon or not. Each pylon will require a specific relic from a zone to activate.
pylonAlpha: false
pylonBeta: false
pylonGamma: false

Character State:


character: {
        name: name, - Self Explanitory, the character's name
        enlightenment: 1, - Traditional Character Level called Enlightenment
        spark: 1, - Similar to Strength, used for Battling
        luminosity: 1, - A unique stat that will be used to determine if a character can explore a zone/ruin freely or not
        items: [] - The character's items
    }


Game Mechanics - 

Primarily revolving around exploring areas within the Zones. Most likely just a single Explore action while in the zone. This will be RNG based where you might get an event, or a combat might start. 

Structure - 
Structure a zone like this: ZoneOneComponent (press explore button) -> Randomizes 1-100 -> Random number picks Event or Battle or Whatever -> Load corresponding component (Hard coded information for each within the ZoneOneComponent)

Future Features: Save Button, Character Progression, Items?Rng?
